/**
 * This is the VariablesDataTypesOperators class, part of the Developer Kickstart Module 1 curriculum 
 * at Cloud Code Academy. This class serves as an introduction to the basic elements of Apex programming 
 * including variables, data types, and operators.
 * 
 * This class is an essential tool for beginner developers who are just starting their journey in Salesforce 
 * development. It covers all the foundational elements necessary to understand and write Apex code effectively.
 * 
 * Topics covered in this class include:
 * - Understanding different data types in Apex such as Integer, Decimal, Double, String, Boolean, etc.
 * - Understanding how to declare and use variables in Apex.
 * - Understanding how to use various types of operators in Apex including arithmetic operators, 
 *   comparison operators, logical operators, and more.
 *
 * Users of this class can expect to gain a strong foundation in Apex programming and be prepared for 
 * more advanced topics in Salesforce development.
 * 
 * If statements are not specifically covered in the lesson this module, but review module 2 flow control section for an overview if needed.
